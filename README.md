# Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier

### Build a neural network SMS text classifier to identify messages using the SMS Spam Collection dataset

This project was part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning curriculum, where I developed a neural network SMS text classifier. Working in Google Colaboratory, I utilized the SMS Spam Collection dataset to train a model that classifies messages as either 'ham' or 'spam.' I created a function called predict_message, which returns the likelihood of a message being 'ham' or 'spam,' and tested the model to ensure accurate predictions.
